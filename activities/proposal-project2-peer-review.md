The following is the peer review of the project proposal by morgenk. The team members that participated in this review are 

- Kiana Fields - @kfields1

- Describe the goal of the project.

The goal is to create website with a shiny app allowing users to explore trends across episodes in the show Avatar: The Last Airbender. 

- Describe the data used or collected.

They are using a package by Avery Robbins that has a dataset with transcripts, writers, directors, and IMBD ratings of every episode of Avatar. The dataset has 12 variables and 13,385 rows.

- Describe how the research question will be answered, e.g. what approaches / methods will be used.

The research questions are centered around exploring trends in the scripts across episodes/time and compare ratings. They are using a shiny app for website users to explore these trends themselves.

- Is there anything that is unclear from the proposal?

The approach/method of answering these research questions beyond use of a shiny app is unclear.

- Provide constructive feedback on how the team might be able to improve their project.

Elaborating on the functions of the shiny app itself would clarify the approach/method. Outlining the intended inputs/outputs of the shiny app would be good.

- What aspect of this project are you most interested in and would like to see highlighted in the presentation.

I'm interested to see how line distribution across episodes differs by character, and character gender as well as how the IMBD ratings changed over time. 

- Provide constructive feedback on any issues with file and/or code organization.

Repo organization looks really comprehensive and makes sense! I would recommend updating the main README.md file. 

- (Optional) Any further comments or feedback?

I love Avatar: The Last Airbender, this project seems super interesting!!
